# 3D Ball Project

This project showcases a 3D ball created using the Three.js library and animated with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).

 The ball responds to mouse events, changing its color dynamically based on mouse movements. The scene also features lighting, camera controls, and a timeline animation.
